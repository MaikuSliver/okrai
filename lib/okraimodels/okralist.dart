description: 
'\u2022 Mild Early Blight is caused by the fungal pathogen Alternaria solani.\n\n'
'\u2022 It appears initially as small, dark brown to black lesions on older leaves, often with concentric rings (target-like appearance).\n\n'
'\u2022 Leaves may yellow around spots, and lesions may coalesce, causing leaf drop.\n\n'
'\u2022 The disease thrives in warm (20-30Â°C) and humid environments, which are common in tropical climates.\n\n'
'\u2022 The pathogen spreads through wind, water splashes, and contaminated equipment.\n\n'
'\u2022 Fungal spores can survive on crop debris, allowing the disease to persist in fields from season to season.\n\n'
'\u2022 High humidity and prolonged leaf wetness favor the diseases development and spread.\n\n'
'\u2022 Early blight can reduce photosynthetic activity, affecting the plants overall health and yield potential.\n\n'
'\u2022 Disease symptoms can also extend to stems and fruits if left untreated, potentially affecting fruit quality.\n\n'
'\u2022 In severe cases, extensive defoliation occurs, exposing fruits to sunscald and reducing crop yield.',

whattodo:  
'\u2022 Rotate crops regularly, avoiding planting okra or other Solanaceae crops in the same area consecutively.\n\n'
'\u2022 Prune lower and infected leaves to improve air circulation, which helps to reduce humidity levels around the plant.\n\n'
